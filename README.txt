There's alot of breadcrumb modules out there, but none of them build
true breadcrumbs.

Cookie Crumbs, makes use of cookies (hence the name), to provide
history based breadcrumbs, and not the herical standard ones.


INSTALLATION
------------

Install the module like with other modules. It depends on Libraries API
and a library called henselsrevenge. For more info on how to get this
library, you are adviced to visit admin/reports/status on your site,
once you've installed the plugin.
